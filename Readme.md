# CNN Implementation for MNIST Digit Classification

## Project Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is designed to achieve an accuracy of 99.5% or more by adding a single convolutional layer and a single MaxPooling 2D layer to the architecture. The goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of CNNs in image classification tasks.

## Background

The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9), divided into a training set of 60,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images. Each image is grayscale and has a resolution of 28x28 pixels. CNNs are particularly effective for image processing due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies in images.

## Features

- Implementation of a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Custom early stopping callback to prevent overfitting
- Achieves over 99.5% accuracy on the MNIST test set

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy

You can find the complete list of required packages in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cnn-mnist.git
   cd cnn-mnist
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Make sure you have the MNIST dataset available. If not, the code will automatically download it when executed.
2. Run the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. The model will start training, and the training history will be printed to the console. The model will stop training once the accuracy reaches or exceeds 99.5%.

## Code Explanation

### Data Loading and Inspection

The project begins by loading the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and inspecting its structure. The dataset is loaded into training and test sets, which are then normalized.

```python
data_path = "mnist.npz"
(training_images, training_labels), _ = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data(path=data_path)
```

### Data Preprocessing

A function named `reshape_and_normalize` is defined to reshape the images and normalize pixel values to the range [0, 1].

```python
def reshape_and_normalize(images):
    # Reshape and normalize pixel values
    images = images.reshape((images.shape[0], 28, 28, 1)).astype('float32') / 255.0
    return images
```

### CNN Model Definition

The CNN model is defined in the `convolutional_model` function. The architecture consists of a convolutional layer followed by a max pooling layer, and it is compiled with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy loss.

```python
def convolutional_model():
    model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
        tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model
```

### Early Stopping Callback

A custom callback `EarlyStoppingCallback` is implemented to halt training once the accuracy surpasses 99.5%.

```python
class EarlyStoppingCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        if logs.get('accuracy') >= 0.995:
            self.model.stop_training = True
            print("\nReached 99.5% accuracy, stopping training!")
```

### Model Training

The model is trained using the `fit` method, and the training history is plotted to visualize accuracy and loss.

```python
model = convolutional_model()
training_history = model.fit(training_images, training_labels, epochs=10, callbacks=[EarlyStoppingCallback()])
```
